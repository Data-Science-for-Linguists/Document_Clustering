### License Notes
Initially, I was going to go with the MIT license because I'm all about making things as free as possible.
However, I've switched to GNU GPLv3, because this requires anyone who uses my code to also make their work available under the same terms.

In terms of sharing data, I'm currently only using wikipedia, which according to [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reusing_Wikipedia_content) is basically licensed under CC-BY-SA, which allows me to share, distribute, and copy it, but requires me to distribute the resulting work only under the same, similar or a compatible license. I'm converting formats (XML dump -> wikiextractor format -> JSON), but the actual content will remain the same.

My data could be all on github, but it's far too large for that, so I'll be keeping just a few samples on github and storing most of it locally.
