| 09/30/2017 | Created project repo and added plan, progress report, license, and readme. | 
| 10/08/2017 | Added jupyter notebook. Since my data will be list of URLs (eventually 1000s of them), I wrote a simple function to strip out tags and leave the page text. I also experimented with the Wikipedia API. The main challenge for my project is clustering and measuring semantic distances, both of which I don't know how to do. So for now, I'm focusing on figuring out gensim and word2vec, etc with a dummy list of 4 wikipedia pages.|
